# NetworkTopologies
Building functions for creating famous network families. All families are grouped by their idea into separate files with several functions inside to build a certain topology. Files include built in commentaries (delete after reading). All topologies are ready to be used to solve image recognition problems. Calling function you can specify only input shape of images and number of classes even without diving into additional parameters. Example of that with summary and visualization is included into each topology file.

## Google Net
This family is heavily productive but complicated to understand. For example includes separate topologies for training and inference.
* Inception Network
* Exception network

## Mobile Net
This topology family is dedicated to create small but potent network capable of working on devices with limited capabilities like mobile devices
* Mobile Network
* Mini Concolutional Neural Network
