# NetworkTopologies
Building functions for creating famous network families. All families are grouped by their idea into separate files with several functions inside to build a certain topology. Files include built in commentaries (delete after reading).

## Table of contents
* [Google Net](#google-net)
* [Mobile Net](#mobile-net)

## Google Net
This family is heavily productive but complicated to understand. For example includes separate topologies for training and inference.
* Inception Network
* Exception network

## Mobile Net
This topology family is dedicated to create small but potent network capable of working on devices with limited capabilities like mobile devices
* Mobile Network
* Mini Concolutional Neural Network
